![Services](/docs/documentation/SAPJAMIntegrationImages/EnableJamService.png?raw=true)
  - You have running ESPM application and deployed to SAP HCP as described in master branch
  - In the below guide, replace account information with your trial account. The application name is “espm” during deployment.





# Overview of External Application Integration in SAP Jam

SAP Jam is capable of incorporating business data in SAP Jam groups without the need to build an OpenSocial gadget. As long as the business data is exposed to SAP Jam via an OData service, SAP Jam can render the business data as part of a SAP Jam group.
SAP Jam uses a generic mechanism to render data exposed via OData services. Therefore, a developer only has limited influence on how the data is rendered inside of SAP Jam via an "annotations.xml" file.





# Business Scenario

Now, Imagine the business case where you have an

  - E-commerce application that sells various IT products
  - Customers can write reviews about the products
  - If you could analyze this massive customer reviews of the products and use that information to make business decisions on product sales, promotions etc. All this in a social manner where product managers and sales team collaborate on product reviews and analysis.

This is the story what ESPM – SAP Jam Integration showcases.
ESPM is a web shopping application running on SAP HANA Cloud platform with HANA as the underlying database.
Customers can write reviews on the products
The product reviews information from within SAP HANA Cloud Platform can be fetched into SAP Jam and you can analyze on the reviews for each product like Top Rated Products, Bottom rated products etc. to make business decisions.





# Implementation

The business data that is exposed in this scenario is the product reviews written by customers for products in ESPM application. The data is exposed as OData.

https://espmxxxxxxxtrial.hanatrial.ondemand.com/espm-cloud-web/espm.svc/Products 

https://espmxxxxxxxtrial.hanatrial.ondemand.com/espm-cloud-web/espm.svc/CustomerReviews 

The “annotations.xml” file used by SAP Jam to render the data is created for you and available within the ESPM application.

https://espmxxxxxxxtrial.hanatrial.ondemand.com/espm-cloud-web/webshop/reviews_annotations.xml

For understanding the annotations.xml file tags, please refer the [documentation](http://help.sap.com/download/documentation/sapjam/developer/index.html#intguide/concepts/DevelopAnODataAnnotationsFileToDisplayBusinessRecords.html)

With the “annotations.xml” file and the data exposed via OData available, we can create an external application in SAP Jam that brings in products and product reviews data from the ESPM application into SAP Jam. Then create SAP Jam group for each product and its associated product reviews and collaborate within SAP Jam on the business data.
